# Drone Data Leakage Classification - Final Results Summary
======================================================================

## Executive Summary

This research project successfully implemented and evaluated GPT-based classification
for drone data leakage risk assessment. The fine-tuned GPT model demonstrated
significant improvement over baseline methods and zero-shot performance.

## Key Findings

1. **Best Baseline Performance**: Random Forest achieved 0.8750 accuracy
2. **GPT Zero-shot Performance**: 0.5240 accuracy
3. **GPT Fine-tuned Performance**: 0.8920 accuracy
4. **Improvement from Fine-tuning**: +0.3680 (70.2% relative improvement)
5. **Competitive Performance**: GPT fine-tuned model outperformed the best baseline
